# blockchain
- blockchain is an open and distrubuted ledger, which can recorf trasaction betwrrn tow parties in permenent way

## Characteristic:
- Open - anyone can access it.
- Distrubuted - blockchain dose not live in a datacentet insted each miner owns a copy of blockchain.
- Ledger - mannered log of each transaction.
- Transaction - this are recorded on the ledger.
- Permanent - to delet transaction all its sub transaction should be removed hence its `immutable`.

## Bitcoin 
- Tt all startrd with a white paper for peer to peer electronic cash system.

## Distributed ledger technology
- Blockchain are distributed means millions of nodes controlling blockchain.
- So if you want to hack blockchain you need to hack all the nodes at same time (That's near to impossible).

## Working
1. Sends the request to P2P.
2. This request willl broadcast to all the nodes.
3. Then it will validate by each node.
4. Then miner will verify the request and add it to the block.
5. After this is confiremd after enough block have been added

# Type of blockchain
1. Public blockchain
2. Private blockchain
3. Permissionless blockchain

## Public blockchain
- Anyone can use this blockchain.
- Bitcoin is an example of public block chain.

## Attributes of a public blockchain.
- Easy acccount creation
- Distributed ledger storage
- Decentralized validation
- Decentralized Block creation
- Decentralized Governance

## Private vs Permissionless blockchain
- In this blockchain one must be invited and very few confirm the transaction.
### Diffrence form public blockchain
- Private transaction
- Authentication process
- Not truly decentralized
- Less transperent
- Partial immutability
