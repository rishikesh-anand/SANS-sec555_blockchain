#                                           blockchain
- blockchain is an open and distrubuted ledger, which can recorf trasaction betwrrn tow parties in permenent way

## Characteristic:
- Open - anyone can access it.
- Distrubuted - blockchain dose not live in a datacentet insted each miner owns a copy of blockchain.
- Ledger - mannered log of each transaction.
- Transaction - this are recorded on the ledger.
- Permanent - to delet transaction all its sub transaction should be removed hence its `immutable`.

## Bitcoin 
- Tt all startrd with a white paper for peer to peer electronic cash system.

<h2> Distributed ledger technology </h2>

- Blockchain are distributed means millions of nodes controlling blockchain.
- So if you want to hack blockchain you need to hack all the nodes at same time (That's near to impossible).

## Working 
1. Sends the request to P2P.
2. This request willl broadcast to all the nodes.
3. Then it will validate by each node.
4. Then miner will verify the request and add it to the block.
5. After this is confiremd after enough block have been added

# Type of blockchain
1. Public blockchain
2. Private blockchain
3. Permissionless blockchain

## Public blockchain
- Anyone can use this blockchain.
- Bitcoin is an example of public block chain.

<h3> Attributes of a public blockchain. </h3>

- Easy acccount creation
- Distributed ledger storage
- Decentralized validation
- Decentralized Block creation
- Decentralized Governance

### Private vs Permissionless blockchain
- In this blockchain one must be invited and very few confirm the transaction.
### Diffrence form public blockchain
- Private transaction
- Authentication process
- Not truly decentralized
- Less transperent
- Partial immutability

# Types of Blockchain
1. Tokenized 
2. Tokenless

## Tokenized Blockchain
- Value carrying blockchain which require a base unit of value it's called token.

## Tokenless Blockchain
- It does not have base value for transfer.
- Just have base properties likes Immutability, security etc etc ...
- E.g. Private Blockchain.

# Use of Blockchain
- Crypto payment
- Darknet market
- DeFi
- Dapp
- Privicy Token
- Proof of ownnership
- Consumer user cases
- Supply chain
- Authentication
- Edcutation diploma
- Insurance
- Govrement use case 

## Crypto Transaction
- Most popular use of blockchain.
- Compared to traditional payment much less cost and much more speed.

## DeFi
- Here, you are the bank.
- Whole diffrent from CeFi.

## Dapp
- Tradationally its Client -> Server -> Database
- But in Dapp it's External account -> Smart contract -> Blockchain

## Privacy and utility tokens
- See, Coin is digital cash but token is representation of assets.
- Diffrent type of token exists 1. utility token 2. Security token.

## Darknet Market
- This blockchain algo is used in crypto markets and for transaction they use Cryptocurrency.

## Supply chain
- Its use here also beacuse, it is to be seen that nothing should be change in supply network.
- And if anything cganges the entire network will know.

<h2> Authentication </h2>

- Simply means prove something whthout showing that we are proving.

## Edcutation Diploma
- Here ZK proofs are used.
- E.g. - whenyou need to show that you are passed but dont want to show the grade here ZK proof helps.

## Insurance
- To detect furad easily

## Goverment use case
- To make a secure voting system as usps did and it's awesome.
- From this system every citizen of us can see their vote anytime using their key and still they can count it.

##  Proof of Ownnership
- Here NFT comes in and boom they can use to track ownnership via blokchain.

#                                           Smart Cotracts
- An arrangement between two or more parties exchanging digital assets, where at least
one of these parties allocates digital assets at the contracts initiation which are then
redistributed to all involved parties in accordance with a predefined protocol encoded in
logic and a state that is initialized at the start of the contract.

## Purpose
- It enables blockchain to move from single puropse such as crypto to multi purpose form platform used to deploy various decentralized application

## Smart Contract brief
- Program running on smart contract can execute automatically when some condition are met.

## Supply change usage 
- Provinance firm is using smart contract to track his incredint form source to consumer.

## DiFi
- Creating monetry banking service
- It has changed the traditional financial products to open source adn decentralised world 

## Gambling
- Smart contracts are also used in gambling as vurtial casino.

## Social network
- Making decentralised social network that is free of bots and fake accounts.

## Gaming
- Yeah it's in gaming and in that some users may rewarded in NFT's.

## EOS.IO
- EOS.IO is a blockchain protocol powered by the native cryptocurrency EOS. It is a smart contract platform that claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second, much faster than Bitcoin and similar protocols.

## Hyperledger 
- It's a project of servel opensourece blockchain and blockchain tools are started by the linux foundatation.

## Corda
- Provide private blockchain solutation.
